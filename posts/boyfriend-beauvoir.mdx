Hey Extrastentialists,

I’m starting to have a tiny little problem with my boyfriend: he’s turning out to be a bit of a misogynist. Lately, our arguments have been increasing more and more, and they seem to contain the same repetitive notions about my gender. My boyfriend and I happen to work for the same company, in the same division. It’s where we met, and it’s something I’ve been grateful for in the past as I get to spend more time with him than I would if our work lives were completely separate. That’s not to say we haven’t experienced some problems tied to our circumstance; since working with him, I’ve seen him make some attitude adjustments to the women he works with. I’m not sure if it’s the environment or the positions in which they work, but something changes in his approach to these matters. Recently, our company issued a promotion to one of the members of our division, and seeing as my boyfriend and I share that division, we were both up for consideration. From the start, we agreed on support for one another regardless of who was offered the position. 

Flash-forward two weeks and I am in our boss’s office accepting my new promotion! I was so excited to celebrate this with my boyfriend, but when I got home that night, he acted like a completely different person from the one I know. He was closed off and refused to look me in the eye for most of the night. I finally confronted him about his negativity towards my promotion, and that’s when he lost it. He claimed that I didn’t deserve the promotion and that I wasn’t working nearly as hard as he was. He said that I didn’t deserve such a high position because I was a woman, and “women don’t belong in such positions.” In his eyes, women should instead take on more domesticated roles–essentially, he would prefer for me to be a housewife. He went on, stating how he’d use this promotion to increase his income to support me and our future, and how he imagined me staying home with our children one day. He asked me if I’d consider stepping down and terminating my contract with our company. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to pursue something that could drive a wedge between me and my boyfriend, but I also want to make a living for myself. I like my job, I like where I work, and I like that I have my own professional endeavors, but this relationship is also really important to me. I’m torn on what the right next step is. Please help!

Best,

Dear Doubtful,

First, I’d like to extend my condolences for the situation you find yourself in. I, too, have experienced some of the inequalities faced by women, especially in the workforce. I sympathize with your lack of direction, and I hope this segment provides guidance on how you can proceed.

As a feminist, many of my personal ideals are rooted in my belief of the importance of autonomy and individual freedom in life and relationships. Oftentimes, men and women find themselves divided by this presence of a patriarchal mindset. Women can be seen as “the Other” in societal situations, in which we are viewed in relation to men and their standards, rather than as separate individuals with our own aspirations and goals in life. With that being said, it can be hard to experience a genuine connection in relationships, let alone maintain a prospering intimacy with your partner. Women are constantly expected to conform to the limitations of traditional gender roles for the satisfaction of men instead of pursuing their own interests and dreams. Because of this patriarchal divide between men and women, it is quite difficult to love ethically and deeply when reciprocity between a man and a woman can be so scarce. 

When building and maintaining a genuine relationship, equality is key–recognizing the gender dynamics of a relationship can fuel inequality and resentment among couples. Some of the time, women will act in ‘bad faith’ towards their situations and refuse to acknowledge their predicaments out of fear of having to make consequential decisions. This restriction we emplace on our freedom can often hinder our solidarity as fellow human beings. In order to have a true, loving relationship, liberation has to occur–there must be a mutual recognition between the two as separate beings who are on equal grounds. If there is no mutual respect between partners, it is difficult to expand on our freedoms as women. 

My advice to you centers around your need for abandoning temptations of bad faith. Choose to pursue the freedom and equality you deserve in this matter. Should you continue to question your position in the relationship and restrict your freedoms in the company solely because your partner cannot look past your gender identity, you will never accomplish true intimacy within your relationship. I understand the importance of this man in your life; however, if he cannot abandon his patriarchal ideals and expectations for you based on your gender, then he is not the one for you. You limit yourself and your freedoms in life when you act in bad faith and ignore the necessary choices within your relationship. No man is worth jeopardizing your individual freedom and rights to equality. Make the right choice, dear!

Sincerely, 

Simone de Beauvoir*
