In the year 2019, devastation rattled the Earth as the Eastern Hemisphere became riddled with the spread of a SARS-CoV-2 virus known as COVID-19 and fell victim to its horrors. Not long after, the virus’s reach expanded to countries in the Western Hemisphere, ravaging the world for its safety, stability, normalcy, and freedom as a whole. The destructive nature of COVID-19 killed hundreds of thousands of people and left tens of millions of people to suffer and endure its wreckage and grief. With COVID-19 came isolation and destitution. With the expanse of COVID-19 growing, hysteria and panic took control. In attempts to slow the effects of the virus, countries initiated a worldwide lockdown, a quarantine that would last for more than two years. 

After COVID-19, the functioning of the world has never been the same. Nations have turned to extreme measures in efforts to restore stability to their economies and restore a sense of normalcy to our new world. Just recently, China announced its decision on reopening its borders to external elements since the nation’s shutdown back in 2019, a time in which COVID-19 had hit the country the hardest. Since then, China has taken a number of measures to reinstate itself in the world and return itself to its former glory. This move is expected to have a significant impact on the global economy, as China is one of the world's largest economies and a major player in international trade, and signals a step towards normalcy in a post-pandemic world. 

Since its shutdown, China’s well-being as a nation has dwindled. China is no longer a “hotspot destination” for tourism, leaving its popularity amongst foreign influencers in drastic need of attention. In 2019, China experienced over 670 million cross-border trips within its country; in 2022, the number of China’s cross-border navigators dropped to 115.7 million. With a drop in its tourism consumption, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew just short of 3% in 2022—the worst the country has witnessed in nearly half a century. 

Along with its social and economic downturns, the welfare of its citizens has greatly diminished. The COVID-19 pandemic required a great deal of sacrifice from the Chinese people, with the separation of family weighing heavily on their hearts. Because of the lockdown, families missed many important milestones, such as graduations, births, marriages, etc., in the lives of their loved ones. When asked about the change brought about by the pandemic, citizens responded, “We are not free anymore, there are too many restrictions because of the pandemic.” Throughout the lockdown, an overwhelming sense of fear and entrapment submerged the people of China into a state of unnatural obedience, forcing the compliance of its citizens and their liberties.

Back in January 2023, China experienced a partial reopening of its country, disbanding its quarantine for international arrivals, and instilling happiness and joy for its citizens who had been isolated inside the country with their loved ones overseas. For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began three years ago, foreign offices are now able to process applications for all categories of Chinese visas as of March 15th, a huge milestone for the people of China. Beijing authorities have declared a “major and decisive victory” over the virus and have recognized the damage endured from its zero-COVID strategy—from a steep decline in its economic development to civil unrest from its demanding and isolating policies. As the Chinese government continues to expand and improve its zero-COVID policies, it seems as though the country is heading in the right direction for restoration—but many question if China’s optimism will prevail with its open borders, or will devastation enrapture the country as it once did three years ago? 

We here at Extrastentialism have worked to provide insight from some of the greatest minds in history, and reflect their ideologies into our interpretations! Let’s see what these philosophers *potentially would have* had to say:

### Albert Camus
Albert Camus, an ingenious French philosopher, heavily emphasized on the importance of individual freedom and human dignity in life, and valued the sentiments of solidarity and notions of unification among people in response to obstacles or challenges faced as a whole. With such delicacies in mind, it should come as no surprise for Camus’s spotlight on the matters. With his writing and publication of his work, The Plague, Camus has indulged in scenarios of epidemics and their effects on not only the physical environment, but on the internal reflections of individuals and their experiences. Given China’s circumstances near the end of 2019, Camus would have viewed its decision on shutting down its borders as a necessary means to prevent any further spread of the virus and ensure protection of its citizens. Though cautious of the risk to public health, Camus would have worried about the strains placed upon the individual freedom and welfare of the Chinese people. 

With such devastatingly harsh restrictions and policies implemented, the Chinese people have been subject to a massive amount of grief over the past few years of the pandemic, so having these limitations lifted would have been seen as a significant step in overcoming the isolation of their experiences and reconnecting with the rest of the world through Camus’s eyes. Though maybe necessary due to the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, Camus’s beliefs of solidarity and people joining together to combat a universal obstacle might not have aligned with the world’s reaction to the virus. His beliefs on solidarity were overshadowed by the world’s response of isolation. Rather than restricting themselves from one another, Camus might’ve vouched for collective action among the nations to address the effects of the global pandemic. Though it’s difficult to say what Camus might’ve said on the matter, we can always look to his philosophical values to help guide us during such times of trouble. 

### Soren Kierkegaard
Soren Kierkegaard, a Danish theologian, was a brilliant man. His views on ethical lifestyles and our ethical mode of existence as enlightened many. In Kierkegaard’s eyes, the choice to reopen the borders could be seen as a practical decision that supports an aesthetic lifestyle, where personal gain involving trade is prioritized. However, there are also ethical and moral considerations to be taken into account with the new open borders. Considering the impact of the open borders being beneficial for others outside of China would align with an ethical lifestyle, by prioritizing the good of the many. The flip side of this, considering the good of the citizens of China, their health and wellbeing, there are pros and cons to this decision, and could be viewed as either ethical for the benefits, or an aesthetic decision by overshadowing the negatives for citizens in favor of trade. At first glance, this could be seen as a largely aesthetical lifestyle supporting decision, however, there are ethical points of view that could have been factored into this choice. According to Kierkegaard, ethical striving inevitably fails–an ethical person may reach a point of despair because of their own moral failures, but can continue their efforts in living an ethical lifestyle. 

### Friedrich Nietzsche
Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher, was revolutionary for his time. Though his philosophies were not directed towards issues related to global health crises, his general views on human nature and politics can create an idea of his response to China’s predicament. Nietzsche’s beliefs emphasized the importance of individualism in life, and made a strong rejection to the “herd morality,” which can be described as a mentality that suggests a strong following of the “herd” or crowd around us. Instead of expressing our individual freedom and values, we tend to conform to moral demands outside of ourselves. 

The power differentials within these demands can often motivate different conceptions of morality or views on how individuals should live, and with China’s strict enforcement of its zero-COVID policies, the Chinese citizens might have been led into a herd morality under their country, with the government instilling fear in its people if they should deviate from such plans. Though his philosophies do not condone “herd morality,” Nietzsche might have viewed the pandemic as a mark of resilience from the people. His philosophies weighed heavily on the importance of challenge and struggle in life as a means of improvement for one’s self. Being subject to the pandemic, while rather harsh, could have provided the people of China with opportunity to demonstrate their strength as individuals–or so Nietzsche might have believed. With such a complex field of ideals, it’s hard to pinpoint Nietzsche’s opinions on the circumstances of China and its borders.
