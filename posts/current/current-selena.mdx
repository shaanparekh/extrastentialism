Have you been living under a rock? Did you delete social media in the past year to create some separation between yourself and the soul-sucking entity that is the internet? If so, buckle up. We’re about to take a journey through the feud between Hailey Bieber (formerly known as Hailey Baldwin) and Selena Gomez.

Canadian superstar Justin Bieber and Disney Channel royalty Selena Gomez dated on and off between 2010 and 2018. Their tumultuous relationship captured the attention of fans across the globe, some of whom fiercely rooted for the couple (#jelena) despite negative press. In 2018, the power couple called it quits for good. 

A mere six months later, Justin Bieber proposed to Hailey Baldwin. At the time, a source close to Justin said that he was “totally in love with Hailey,” but “there will always be a soft spot in his heart for Selena.” Ms. Baldwin became Mrs. Bieber in September of 2018, and the couple has remained married since.

In 2020, Gomez released a song entitled “Lose You to Love Me” that fans presume is about her and Bieber’s split. Lyrics of the pop hit include “I needed to lose you to find me” and “I needed to hate you to love me.” The song also mentions being replaced within months, which sparked accusations that Hailey “stole” Justin from Selena. Social media platforms began to overflow with users trying to prove the feud between Ms. Bieber and Gomez by picking apart their posts and public behavior down to the smallest detail. Attempts by each of the celebs to stop the online hate were unsuccessful.

It is evident from Gomez’s breakup song that the love she and Mr. Bieber shared was harmful; therefore, from the the viewpoint of Jean-Paul Sartre, the separation allowed Gomez to take back some of the power that she gave Mr. Bieber. Ms. Bieber likely seeks recognition from her husband in their romantic relationship and attempts to seduce him into loving her more. As Sartre would conclude, Ms. Bieber will always doubt the sincerity of her husband’s love for her because of this manipulation. Furthermore, the public’s continual comparison between Gomez and Ms. Bieber likely causes Ms. Bieber to feel threatened by Gomez and take on the characteristics of Gomez that she thinks her husband desires.  

In February of this year, things got much worse. Gomez became the most followed woman on Instagram after her follower count passed that of Kylie Jenner (who happens to be friends with Hailey). One day, Selena posted something saying that she accidentally over-laminated her eyebrows, and only a couple of hours later, Jenner posted a screenshot of a FaceTime call with Ms. Bieber in which both women showed a close-up of their eyebrows. All it took was one TikTok user pointing out this coincidence to fan the flame of the feud all over again.

Over the following month, there were several more social media posts that fans read into as evidence of the conflict between Gomez and Ms. Bieber. By mid-March, Gomez’s streaming numbers were spiking, and she had gained 10 million followers on Instagram. Ms. Bieber did not fare as well. Not only had she lost over one million followers, but a post she made for her husband’s birthday was rife with hateful comments. 

Martin Heidegger’s philosophy of the “They” seems to explain what is continuing to fuel this fiery feud. We can think of the millions of faceless individuals on these social media platforms as the They. It is highly likely that Gomez and Ms. Bieber feel immense pressure to conform to the They, resulting in a cycle of seeking validation and approval from others. We might be dealing with conflict between two individuals, but there are much larger societal forces at play here. Heidegger would probably advise the women to resist the temptation of the They and strive to show up authentically on social media. 
 
The Biebers remained relatively quiet throughout the drama. A source close to the couple said that “they do not want this to impact their relationship negatively” and “have been supporting each other privately.” Bieber knows from being in the spotlight most of his life that speaking publicly about the situation would only bring more attention to it.

Finally, on March 24th, Gomez chose to speak out on her Instagram story about the issue. She asked fans to stop harassing Ms. Bieber after she reported receiving death threats from fans of Gomez. Her statement included the following: 

“This isn’t what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I’ve always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop.”

Ms. Bieber responded with a similar sentiment:

“In the end, I believe love will always be bigger than hate and negativity, and there is always an opportunity to meet each other with more empathy and compassion.”

The two stars now follow one another on Instagram. 

Simone de Beauvoir would point out the generosity in these public displays of good will. Gomez reacted generously toward Ms. Bieber, just like she would want for herself, and Ms. Bieber followed suit. A crucial part of generosity is equality between equals, and this idea seems to be recognized by the celebs. They are both famous women who happen to share romantic history with the same person, and Gomez and Ms. Bieber both seem to understand that encroaching upon each other’s differences would do more harm than good.
