Hey Extrastentialists,

I’m feeling conflicted over one of my friendships. Recently I have noticed that she has gotten very focused on partying and dating different guys, while I have been more focused on my studies and personal growth. Now there’s nothing wrong with socializing or having a good time, but I feel like she is always out partying and I’m always home studying. I feel like we are on different paths now and I am unsure how to navigate our friendships without damaging it. I’m worried her lifestyle might be impacting her future and well-being. How can I support her without compromising my values?

Sincerely,

Conflicted Friend

Dear Conflicted Friend,

You seem to be dealing with an existential dilemma regarding lifestyle choices. There are three basic lifestyles in my philosophy framework: the aesthetic lifestyle, the ethical lifestyle, and the religious lifestyle. The aesthetic is focused on pleasure, while the ethical lifestyle is focused on moral duty. It seems like your friend is leading an aesthetic lifestyle, while you are more focused on the ethical life. These are fundamentally different ways of life, and as an ethical individual it is natural for you to be concerned for your friend. You cannot control her choices, although you can express your concerns and offer support. It is also important to consider the impact of this friendship on yourself. Due to the vastly different values, you might want to reevaluate the relationship. It is possible to remain friends with someone who has different values, and help them consider other options along the way, but you should reflect on the relationship as a whole and decide if continuing it would do more harm than good. Instead of focusing on judgment or trying to control your friend, focus on staying true to your own values and priorities.

Sincerely,

Soren Kierkegaard
