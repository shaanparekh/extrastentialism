Hi Extrastentialists,

I’ve been struggling with feeling authentic on social media. I feel like I need to present a certain image and brand online for my followers and to get likes, but that is not really who I am. I’m worried that I’m not being true to myself and sending the wrong message to my followers and friends online. I see influencers and celebrities with seemingly perfect feeds and I feel the need to be like them for success on social media. I wish I could embrace my flaws and my authentic self without losing followers. Do you have any advice on how I can be more authentic on social media, be true to myself, and still gain the following I want?

Sincerely,

Feeling Inauthentic

Dear Feeling Inauthentic,

It seems you are struggling with the notion of authenticity in the context of social media, a common issue in today’s world. In my philosophy, I often discussed the “They”, which refers to the anonymous and impersonal crowd that we are all contributing to when we conform to social norms. The “They” influences us to prioritize the opinions of others over our own individuality. With social media, this is especially true, because there are actually millions of faceless individuals online sharing their opinions on everything within seconds. We can quickly fall prey to the opinions of others and our need for validation from the “They”, and not embrace our own authenticity. To be authentic is to separate from the They. In terms of social media, this would mean embracing flaws and imperfect feeds, and paying no mind to the opinions of others on your social media. This is easier said than done, and requires a great deal of reflection regarding how much you are willing to share online in order to be authentic. And not everyone online will react pleasantly to this, but we cannot control the opinions of others. Reflect on what authenticity means to you, and embrace it on social media and in life. The followers that recognize this and enjoy the content regardless will stick around. Being authentic could even help you to gain a larger following than you thought. Be true to yourself.

Sincerely,

Martin Heidegger*
