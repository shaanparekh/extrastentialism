Dear Existentialists,

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always felt different–it’s as though I feel nothing. Growing up, I knew something was wrong with me. I never processed the world in the same lens as other young children did. Even now, I’m thirty-one years old, I’ve had my fair share of life and its adventures–and yet, I feel nothing. You know, when you’re young you’re told to dream big, to love yourself and those around you unconditionally, and that life has its ways of working itself out. I never thought much about such things, but as time progressed, I found myself staring at a hollow shell of a being in the mirror. There’s this unbearable weight that’s been hanging on my shoulders for so long that I don’t know what to do or how to feel anymore. I recognize myself and my actions, but I can’t seem to make any effort to change.

Six weeks ago, my brother died. As human beings, our very existence is rooted in this expansive intricacy of ideologies and elements that allow us to experience things on a different level. These complexities are what make us who we are, and yet, when my brother died, it was as though I was an empty shell of nothingness. I pretend to grieve the loss of my own brother, when really, I can’t feel anything. It’s not the first time such things have happened, and I fear it won’t be the last. Everyday, I walk through life as though I’m stuck in this trance, senseless from my surroundings. It’s beginning to affect those around me. I have people in my life that rely on me, but I lack the emotional capacity to support their needs, and I can see them fading away from my life. What’s the point in living a meaningless life? I have no direction or drive in life, and I just want to feel things that will help me be who I’m supposed to be. I need help, and I figured this platform would be a place of sanction for me and my circumstances. For this, I leave myself in your ever-evolving hands. 

Best,

Empty,

I’m touched to read your response. It is with a heavy heart that I write to you, as I, too, have encountered the inherent uncertainty and absurdity of the human condition and the state in which we find ourselves meaninglessly wandering through life. I understand the misguidance you feel when trying to comprehend your own emotions, let alone the intricacies of the world around you. Oftentimes, we find our experiences in life to be shaped by a rudimentary tension between our underlying desire to find meaning in what we do and the absurdity of our realities. Absurdism can be a blessing disguised as a misfortune. Life ultimately has no meaning for anyone–a mindset many have fallen victim to and struggle to witness in a new light; however, that very simplicity gives us freedom. If everything in life is absurd, then why shouldn’t we get a choice in our fate? If life is not given a meaning, then you provide your own. When all else seems meaningless, look inside yourself and explore those innermost feelings and emotions that lay hidden beneath your physicality. 

Acknowledging the tensions we face when finding meaning in life and the absurdity of the world can allow for a deeper appreciation and connection to our present selves and provide a sense of liberation from the shackles of empty expectations and hopelessness. Might I suggest that you embrace the absurdities of life; if you’re feeling a sense of numbness or disconnectedness from your inner emotions, explore and engage in activities and experiences that make you happy or give you a sense of purpose. Connecting and communicating with others who are in similar predicaments can help you branch out into the world and will help flourish some of the shared values and interests you may have. Rather than focus on finding meaning in life and your emotions, embrace the absurdity and enjoy your journey through life. Live life fully through your own means, and if you feel lost, look inside yourself and create direction; rather than focusing on where you’ll end up or who you’re meant to be, take a step back and recognize the present and all that’s in front of you, and then make a meaning for yourself. Live life boldly, for absurdity is inherent in our condition, so why not make the most of your time and create your own meaning and direction in life that can inspire your emotions! To live freely, you must accept the uncertainty and meaninglessness of life, for our true purpose is found within, and once ignited, meaning will follow. 

Sincerely,
