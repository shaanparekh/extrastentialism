Dear Extrastentialists,

I feel stuck. I graduated from college four years ago with a degree in advertising. Right after graduating, I landed my dream role at GSD&M, a nationally-known advertising agency located in Austin. The agency went through a rough patch due to the pandemic, and I ended up falling victim to the 2022 layoffs that swept companies across the nation.

I joined a different, smaller ad agency in the Austin area around six months ago. From the beginning, I did not love going into work everyday, but I figured I just needed to go through an adjustment period. I’m sad to say that things have only gotten worse. Part of what drew me to advertising in college is the creative freedom it involves. However, at the agency I currently work at, I feel restricted. Every time I make an effort to create something for my clients that is even slightly outside of the box, my boss calls me into his office. He always says something about how “we need to give the client what they are expecting.” I thought I was hired based on my skill, but I don’t even feel like my skill is valued. While my occupation used to be an outlet in which I could creatively express myself, I now see it as stifling and–honestly–miserable.

As a twenty-something living in an expensive city like Austin, I appreciate the financial stability that this job offers. But at what cost? The thought of staying pains me, and the thought of leaving terrifies me. Please tell me you see a way that I can get out of this situation.

Sincerely,

Craving Creativity

Craving,

I hope to offer some insight into why you are feeling this way. It sounds to me like you are experiencing tension caused by your will to power. All of us have this inherent desire for self-expression and control within the environments we find ourselves in. Your boss is trying to stifle this motivation you have to express yourself through creativity in your role at the agency, and this condemnation of your will is harmful. I firmly believe that a healthy person is one who is willful and aims for self-expression through various avenues. Your first step in mending these circumstances is acknowledging your will to power. Embrace the drive you have to create things that assert parts of who you are.

Based on this analysis, it likely will not come as a surprise that I think the best course of action for you to take is to quit your job. I understand the financial risk involved, but sometimes it is necessary to take risks for the sake of self-expression. My concern is that prolonging your time in this oppressive environment will have the same effect as parents’ attempts to “break the will” of their children (i.e. the need for years of therapy). Your boss clearly desires to control you. While some control is appropriate given your respective positions at the agency, the degree of control your boss is trying to exercise over you seems to relate less to what is best for the company and more to his personal motivations for power.


I understand that leaving the security of the role is fear-inducing, but I am more afraid of what will happen if you continue to allow your creative self-expression to be stifled.

Best,

Friedrich Nietzsche*
