Dear Extrastentialists,

College is not like the movies. Growing up, I had this perception that going to a four-year university would mean opportunities around every corner. I had so much hope for the endless possibilities of life in college and all of the places I could end up after graduating. Now, as a sophomore in the thick of the spring semester, I don’t have many options at all. I go to class, I do homework, and I go to meetings for the various organizations I am involved in. Not only must I meet all of the demands of being a pre-med student at a large university, but I must also please my parents and fulfill the desires they have for my life.

I long for more freedom, for time to breathe and enjoy my life as a young adult. Deviating from my daily routine and four-year plan is simply not an option. As the daughter of an aerospace engineer and a plastic surgeon, I am not the kind of person who will quit my academic or professional pursuits. I am being tossed about by the waves, but still I must continue to attempt to swim. One day, I might just drown. While I’m not sure whose fault it will be, I know it will not be my own. I guess this is a cry for help. Given my limited options, I doubt there is anything you can say to truly help my situation. At the very least, it feels good to anonymously express these feelings.

Thanks,

Drowning from Dedication

Drowning,
I am so glad you wrote in. Let me be the first to tell you that you have it all wrong.

It sounds to me like you are deceiving yourself about how free you really are. I call this kind of behavior acting in bad faith. There are, undeniably, parts of yourself and your circumstances that you are unable to change; for instance, you will always be the daughter of two parents with successful careers in STEM. This is part of your facticity–the facts of the matter of your situation. Additionally, a role that you currently play is that of a college student, but that role does not determine what you are. In fact, you could quit that role at any time (though this option is unattractive). There is another aspect to you, and that is your transcendence, which relates to your freedom beyond your circumstances.

I realize that this freedom is difficult to embrace. Living freely necessitates a certain responsibility in decision-making that can be overwhelming. I advise that you engage in some existential psychoanalysis. Writing about your life in an autobiographical manner could help you do this effectively. You must allow yourself to reflect on your life enough to realize the choices you have already made and those that you have yet to make. I hope that this reflection pushes you towards acting with greater authenticity in your undergraduate experience.

External pressures from family and peers can certainly motivate you to act in certain ways, but you are capable of making choices that resist the motivation to go along with others’ expectations. Although it is not easy, I can guarantee you that embracing your freedom of choice will lead to a more fulfilling life. You can choose not to pursue a medical education. You can choose not to do your homework. You can choose to spend more time with friends. Who you become will be a result of what you do, so choose wisely.

Respectfully,

Jean-Paul Sartre*
